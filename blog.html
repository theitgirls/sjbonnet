  <h2>Dangers of Cyber Security</h2>
<h2>Today's Scavenger Hunt</h2>
<p>Sophia Melendez|July 20,2022</p>
        <p class="tab">
  Today, during class we walked around campus doing a scavenger hunt. My partner and I first visited 
  the ischool advisor, Tess Schaufler. She was able to explain to us how her department (student 
  services) no longer unless paper forms. Her department is mainly in charge of student life. She 
  began explaining to us how she was organizing an orientation for the seniors. Everything must go 
  through the computer as she does not even accept paper forms anymore. She explained to us that for 
  the most part, she only works with graduate students and keeps track of what they need to graduate 
  or holds (like money they might owe or parking tickets) on their accounts. Tess Schaufler also 
  spoke to us about how she uses her computer to keep track of how many people are in each class or 
  want certain classes and provide that information to the enrollment department. All in all, I 
  learned plenty about the advisor’s job here at Syracuse and I was really fascinated.

  <h2>My Teachable Machine</h2>
        <p>Sophia Melendez|July 19,2022</p>
  <p class="tab">
        Today in my IT girls course, we did an activity with teachable machine. My partner and I created a
    machine in order to be able to tell the emotion of a person as they entered the room. We included
    basic human emotions such as, anger, shock, happiness, sadness, thinking, and we also included a 
    neutral emotion. We did this by hooking up a webcam to our computer and using the “Pose Project” 
    button to create it. We stood far enough from the camera so that it would be able to see our 
    entire bodies and we acted out what we thought these emotions might look like. Then we trained 
    our machine and tested it out. We had split the emotions between ourselves so we both only did 
    three. Upon testing out our machine, we realized it wouldn’t work unless we both included data 
    of both of us doing each emotion. Finally, after including tons of data and retrying our idea a 
    few times, we were able to get it to work on both of us and we presented it to our class. After 
    this experience, I could see AI being used to help people see what their students might be 
    feeling or doing in class while taking an exam. My classmates did a similar project where they 
    acted as students writing, on their phone and spaced out. This would help many teachers to 
    prevent cheating during exams or to keep focus during class.

        <h2>Women In Cryptology</h2>
        <p>Sophia Melendez|July 19,2022</p>
        <p class="tab">
            Mary Louise Prather was born in Washington D.C. in 1913(the exact date is unknown). 
            She was active during World War II and is known most for her work in Cryptology at that 
            time. She was also active during the early Cold War era. She first joined the SIS
            (Signal Intelligence Service) and was a civilian stenographer. This was in 1938 and 
            qualified as an entry level position. Two years later in 1940, after working a variety
            of jobs in which she worked with many machines in the office, she would receive the 
            position of Chief of the Stenographic section.
        </p>
     <p class="tab">
        Mary Louise Prather was awarded with the Commendation for Meritorious civilian
        Service Award in 1946. She would continue to work in the offices of cryptography until she was
        promoted in 1960 to Chief of The Soviet Information Division. She would later go on to
        retire in 1969 working as the Division Chief of National Security Agency. She was also
        awarded with the Meritorious Civilian Service Award. She would pass away in 1996 at 
        the age of 82-83.
