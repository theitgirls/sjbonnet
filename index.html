        <h1>Sophia Melendez' Biography</h1>
        <p style="color:rgb(255, 133, 154)"> 
        Hi, I'm Sophia. I'm a rising senior and I'm from Brooklyn, New York. I decided to take this class because I foresee myself pursuing a career in computer engineering or computer science and wanted to learn more about the topics and begin my journey. Outside of school, I spend much of my time with friends and I'm a chorus major at my high school in the city. I'm also a part of the national children's choir so I also spend a lot of my time outside and inside of school on vocals. I enjoy reading books and thrifting and love putting new outfits together and finding new pieces to work with. Looking forward to getting to know you all!
